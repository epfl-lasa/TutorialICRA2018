<p><span style="color: #008000;">Lukas Huber is a Postgraduate Student and doing his Master Thesis in the Learning Algorithm and System Laboratory (LASA) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
Lausanne (EPFL). He is going to obtain his M.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering, with focus on Mechatronics in Summer 2018. He holds a B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering (2016) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ). Prior to this, he has concluded student research projects at the Laboratory of Energy Conversion (LEC) at ETHZ (2015) and the Institute of Dynamical System an Control (IDSC) at ETHZ (2016) and a postgraduate research project at the Automatic Control Laboratory (LA) at EPFL (2017). His research interest focus on robot control, dynamical system based motion generation, multi-
arm manipulations and autonomous mobile robots. His current research focuses on obstacle avoidance based on dynamical system theory.</span></p>
