<p><span style="color: #008000;">Aude Billard is Professor and head of the LASA Laboratory at the School of Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Prior to this, she was Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Southern California, where she retains an adjunct faculty position to this day. Aude Billard received a B.Sc. (1994) and M.Sc. (1995) in Physics from EPFL, with specialization in Particle Physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), an M.Sc. in Knowledge based Systems (1996) and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence (1998) from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. Her research interests focus on machine learning tools to support robot learning through humanguidance. This extends also to research on complementary topics, including machine vision and its use in human-robot interaction and computational neuroscience to develop models of learning in humans.</span></p>
