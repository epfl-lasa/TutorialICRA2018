<p style="text-align: center;font-size:125%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> Abstract</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:90%">The use of Dynamical Systems (DS) for motion planning problems in robotics has become popular thanks to their ability to generate on-line motion plans inherently robust to changes in dynamic environments. In recent years, we have focused on formulating DS to model robotic tasks that can be learned from demonstrations (LfD). We have used our DS-based learning techniques in a plethora of robotic applications, from executing simple point-to-point motions, such as pick-and-place and imitating motion patterns to more dynamic scenarios, such as generating golf swings, obstacle avoidance and even catching objects in flight. These techniques have been further extended to learn more complex tasks of repetitive nature, from sequential point-to-point motions to peeling vegetables or rolling pizza dough.
<br>
<br>
In this tutorial, we will introduce techniques used to learn Dynamical Systems from human demonstrations. Further, we will introduce approaches to modify a learned behavior locally, with particular focus on obstacle avoidance and non-contact/contact transitions. Finally, we will present approaches in which DS are used for impedance control and force generation in contact tasks. Attendees will be able to practice and test the presented techniques through computer-based simulations in MATLAB.</p>

In this tutorial, we seek to introduce the attendees to the state-of-the-art of DS-based learning from demonstration from both a theoretical and practical point-of-view. It will be composed of 3 lecture-like presentations followed by practical sessions in MATLAB (to be done on attendeeâ€™s
laptops).

<ul>
  <li style="font-size:90%"> &bull; The first lecture focuses on showcasing different learning approaches proposed by the LASA lab, while highlighting their advantages and drawbacks and comparing them to other approaches.</li>
  <li style="font-size:90%"> &bull;The second lecture, will showcase techniques to locally modulate a previously-learned DS for tasks such as i) obstacle avoidance and ii) transitioning between contact with a surface.</li>
  <li style="font-size:90%"> &bull;The final lecture focuses on the use of DS for impedance control and force generation. We will present a DS-based impedance controller that provides passive interaction while generating motion in a time-invariant manner. We will then present a technique to learn DS that can encode different stiffness characterizations throughout the motion plan. Finally, we will present an approach that is capable of generating both motion and force during contact tasks.</li>

Students will be able to practice these techniques through computer-based simulations. The tutorial will end with a look-out on open research questions in the field. We provide a detailed description of the program under the <a href="https://epfl-lasa.github.io/TutorialICRA2019.io/documentation/Overview.html"> <font color="red"> Documentation </font></a> tab.</p>
